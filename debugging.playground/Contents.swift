//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q3 HERE]
/*  let is creating a constant, and var is creating variable. Also, create a empty dictionary should like this var countLetters = [Character : Int](), In addition, since
    lenA and lenB are the length of two arrays, it will not change later, thus, it is better to declare them as constant by using let. The method only returns true or false, 
    that means the return type should be Bool! becuase we are sure that it has something inside, thus, we can unwrap it there. I also changed return nill to return true at the end     
    of the method. */
